        <h1>Apology to Mom</h1>
        <p>Dear Mom,</p>
        <p>I know you are very upset and dissappointed of how i turned out to be.</p>
        <p>I know it pains you a lot the fact that you have and still are sacrificing a lot for us,</p>
        <p>for you to just hear the nonsense i was uttering yesterday.</p>
        <p>Truth be told whatever i was saying yesterday was a lie, what kind of person doesn't know what to do with their future?</p>
        <p>The truth is actually something has been bothering me a lot and i haven't told someone about it,</p>
        <p>even my teacher noticed it but it was already late.</p>
        <p>Mom ever since that incident i had in school i have never been the same.</p>
        <p>It came to my realisation that i had let a large number of people down,</p>
        <P>especially my mentors(you,dad and the teachers).</P>
        <P>I thought that was my turning point,i told myself i have to recover from this,</P>
        <P>i tried but i ended up failing, i did not even achieve my objectives. </P>
        <p>Since then the trauma has been following me,</p>
        <P>I am a failure that's something that has been eating me up the whole time</P>
        <p>i have never been the same.</p>
        <p>It has affected me big time even now</p>
        <p>My teacher noticed i was not alright stating my contribution in class has decreased.</p>
        <p>We had a one on one session with him but it did not help.</p>
        <p>One solution he gave me was to either go to the counsellor or actually talk to somebody close</p>
        <p>I thought i could talk to you but i did not know how to put it.</p>
        <P>I'm so sorry.
            And thank you for everything.
        </P>
        <p class="signature">With sincere apologies,<br>[Your loving son,
            Raph]</p>
